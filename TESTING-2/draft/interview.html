    <h2>Interview</h2>
    <p>Hello, first of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Akhdan Alhafidh. You can see my student ID card.</p>
    <p>Q : <br>Could you please introduce yourself, mention the university you attended,
        <br>your major, and why you chose
        that
        field of
        study? <br>
        A : <br>I am currently a student at Pamulang University, majoring in Computer Science. <br> I chose this field
        of
        study
        because of my
        deep interest in technology and problem solving. <br>Since high school, I have been fascinated by how software
        can
        solve
        complex problems and improve people's lives. <br>This passion drove me to pursue a degree in Computer Science,
        <br>where
        I could
        learn the skills needed to create innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>Q : <br>Describe a challenging situation you encountered during your university
        career
        and how you overcame it. <br>
        A : <br> One of the most challenging situations I faced during my university career was <br> when I was assigned
        as a
        team
        leader for
        a group project in third year. <br>Our task was to develop a comprehensive software application within a tight
        deadline. <br> Our
        team faced several obstacles, including technical issues and communication breakdowns. <br>To overcome these
        challenges, I
        held regular meetings to ensure clear communication and delegated tasks based on each member's strengths. <br>
        Through
        perseverance and teamwork, we managed to complete this project on time and get high marks for our efforts.</p>
    <p>Q : <br>How do you plan to continue developing your skills after completing this program?
        <br> A : <br>After completing
        this program, I plan to continue developing my skills by keeping up to date <br>with the latest technology
        especially in artificial intelligence. <br>I intend to participate in online courses and attend workshops and
        seminars
        related to computer science and software development. <br>In addition, I would also like to gain practical
        experience
        through internships and collaborative projects. <br>I believe that continuous learning and hands-on experience
        are
        essential
        to remain competitive in the ever-evolving technology industry.
    </p>
    <p>Q : <br>What skills or knowledge gained from the OSC program do you think set you apart
        in the job market? <br> A : <br>
        The OSC program has equipped me with a strong set of technical skills <br>and practical knowledge that I believe
        sets me
        apart in the job market. <br>the program emphasizes on problem-solving and critical thinking, <br>which are
        crucial
        to
        tackle
        complex challenges in the tech industry. <br>In addition, the collaborative projects I worked on during the
        program
        have
        honed my teamwork and leadership skills, <br>making me a well-rounded candidate for any position in the computer
        science
        field.
    </p>
    <p>Thank you for watching my interview. I hope it gave you a good overview of my
        background and skill set. Have a
        great
        day!</p>
